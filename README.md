The folder contains the Jupyter notebook of the experiments described in the paper. The shadow improvement described exhibits an important increase in the evaluated metrics, making it a useful technique that does not require additional computational resources such as GPUs. It also shows a consistent improvement over each image, which means a more robust method to segment the images to make a later process for precision agriculture.
